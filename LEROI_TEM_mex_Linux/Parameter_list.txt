Parameter list and order for the LEROI_TEM function, called in matlab

NCHNL = Number of time gates (normally either 20 or 30, depending on repetition frequency)

REFTYM = Time (in ms) from which TMS or TOPN & TCLS are measured. For example, 
         this could be signal off-time or start of downward ramp.

OFFTYM = time (milliseconds) between end of one pulse and the start of the next pulse (
         of opposite sign) since a bipolar waveform is assumed (lambda/4). For systems which have a signal which is always on, OFFTIME = 0.

TXON   = digitised time (in milliseconds) of each point in the waveform (set at 4 points). 
         In most cases, TXON(1) = 0, TXON(2) = pulse on-time, TXON(3) = pulse off-time, TXON(4) = REFTYM 
         where TXON(4) - TXON(3) = turn off time e.g., [0.0, 0.001, 1.0492, 1.05];

TXAMP  = transmitter current in amps at time TXON(J), normally signal is normalised e.g., [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0];

TOPN   = Start times (in ms) of receiver windows, (1x20);

TCLS   = End times (in ms) of receiver windows, (1x20);

SXE    = east coordinate of vertex I for loop position J (m), fixed at 4 vertices e.g., [5, -5, -5, 5];
         Note the transmitter is fixed on the ground (Z=0) in this adapted Leroi code, 
         for airborne data more parameters will need to be passed through the mex file to model.

SXN    = north coordinate of vertex I for loop position J (m), fixed at 4 vertices e.g., [5, 5, -5, -5];
         Note the transmitter is fixed on the ground (Z=0) in this adapted Leroi code, 
         for airborne data more parameters will need to be passed through the mex file to model.

RXE    = receiver easting (m) ;
RXN    = receiver northing (m) ;
RXZ    = receiver z (always be 0 for ground based TEM);

Test model parameters

NLYR   = number of nuclei

NPLT   = fixed at 0;

NLITH  = number of nuclei

LYTH   = [resisitivity(1), -1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1;
          resisitivity(2), -1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1;
          resisitivity(NLYR), -1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1];

LITHL  = nuclei number e.g., if NLYR = 3 LITHL = [1, 2, 3];

THK    = cell thickness (1 x (NLYR-1));
